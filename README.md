# Pneumonia-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
A research project to detect pneumonia and to compare various models.
We have used a kaggle database for our project which can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.
As we have performed this project on a limited system and not on cloud the results may not be very satisfactory but the hyperparameters are well defined.
